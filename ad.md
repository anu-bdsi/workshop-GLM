The workshop aims to teach generalised linear models for modeling data with non-normal distributions. Participants are expected to have a basic understanding of R and linear models prior to the start of the workshop. 

Learning objectives:

- Understand and apply generalized linear models (GLMs) for modeling data with non-normal distributions 
- Apply GLMs effectively to model binary outcomes (logistic regression) and count data (Poisson or negative binomial regression).
- Fit, interpret, and assess the adequacy of GLMs

The workshop is a total of 3 hours (in-person only delivery) on the dates and times specified below. 

- Tue 24 September 2024 1-2pm 
- Fri 27 September 2024 12-2pm
