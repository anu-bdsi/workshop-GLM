What do you notice?\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nNext let’s looks at the marginal distribution of numerical covariates by the outcome. Why is the median value for timechd clustered around 3000 for those that didn’t have a coronary heart disease?\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nAnswer\n\nThe study went on for 8.5 years (which is about 8.5 \\(\\times\\) 365.25 = 3105 days). The variable timechd for the group that didn’t have a coronary heart disease is related to number of days to end of follow-up. This means that those with earlier time (e.g. 1000 days) within this group means that they dropped out of study for some reason (e.g. due to death or unable to contact participant).\n\n\nLet’s look also at the marginal distribution of categorical variables by the outcome. Do the levels within a factor have a higher association with chd? What do you notice in particular about typechd?\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nAnswer\n\ntypechd is derived from chd so those that did not have a coronary heart disease is all assigned “none” as expected.\n\n\nggpairs() from GGally package is useful for looking at the pairwise relationship between any two covariates in the data. It will be slow to compute if you have many variables (and individual graph may be too slow to see) so you may need to subset to a smaller number of variables first.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nLet’s zoom in and have a look at the relationship between sdp and dbp. What do you notice about the relationship between these variables?\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nAnswer\n\nThe variables sdp and dbp are highly correlated. Systolic pressure (sdp) is the maximum blood pressure during contraction of the ventricles; while diastolic pressure (dbp) is the minimum pressure recorded just prior to the next contraction. Both measure blood pressure (in different ways) so the high correlation is perhaps expected!\n\n\nWhat is the relationship between behave and dibep?\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nAnswer\n\nAll those that are assigned with value “A” for dibep are either “A1” or “A2” for behave. Similarly all that are assigned with value “B” for dipep are either “B1” or “B2” for behave. This suggests that perhaps behave was a further refinement of behaviour type based on dibep (so behave is nested within dibep).\n\n\n\nModel the data\n\nWhy would you not (or would you) use typechd and timechd as predictors in the model?\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\nThe variables typechd and timechd are calculated based on the outcome! You can’t use predictors that were derived based on the outcome.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nDo you think the behaviour type variable (behave) should be included in the model?\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nAnswer\n\nbehave does not appear to be (statistically) significantly contribute to explaining the chd so we omit from the model.\n\n\nWhat do you think the best model that explains chd is?\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nAnswer\n\nVariable selection is a hard problem! We can use stepwise selection (which goes through backward selection - drop the least signiciant variable - and forward selection - add the most significant variable, until it meets a certain criteria), but an “automated” selection like this doesn’t account for the domain context.\nFor example, sdp is in the final model selected by stepwise selection but sdp is highly correlated with dbp. Should dbp been included instead of sdp? Also weight is included but not height. Tall people would naturally weight more than short people with the same body type. Would it have been better to feature engineer another variable that normalises weight with respect to height? Body mass index (which is weight in kg divided by square of body height in metres) is supposed to account for weight with respect to height.\nRemember that all models are wrong, but some are useful. Your goal is just to find a useful model that approximates the reality well enough."
